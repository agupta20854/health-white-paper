== Summary

This Health Spatial Information Framework white paper provides a discussion about the exchange, integration, analysis, and visualization of health and non-health data to support health applications. It identifies opportunities to advance the OGC Standards towards building a framework to support Health Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs).

Developing a Health Spatial Information Framework based on open standards will help health data users and other stakeholders in the following ways:

* *Solution Providers* - to understand market needs and add value to services;
* *Market Participants* - to understand where OGC standards can be applied to support improved health outcomes;
* *Government and Institutes* - to understand market priorities and to design health-oriented SDIs;
* *Standards Organizations* - to understand opportunities to develop or improve standards to support health applications;
* *Researchers* - to have a foundation of elements for advancing research on SDIs and health-related applications using OGC Standards;
* *Health Systems* - to understand how such a framework could contribute to clinician point-of-care decision support and be leveraged to improve outcomes.

The paper builds on contributions from OGC Health Domain Working Group (DWG) members and is informed by OGC Health DWG sessions from 2012-2019, including Summits in 2016 and 2017. Key application areas are addressed, providing a broad scope of market requirements and functional areas:

* Climate-Health
* Healthy Aging
* Global Indicators
* Health in the Smart City
* Disaster Response Scenarios
