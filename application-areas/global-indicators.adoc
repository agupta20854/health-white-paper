=== Global Indicators for Sustainable Development 

Various global initiatives have provided guidance towards global indicators to help monitor the status of health in populations. The initiatives include Sustainable Development Goal developed by the United Nations, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

*United Nations Sustainable Development Goals*

At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015, 193 countries agreed on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For each goal specific objectives and targets were defined (cite:[RN755]). The goal related to health is _Goal 3  Good Health and Wellbeing_. The objective of this goal is to "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages". Thirteen targets and associated indicators were developed by the Interagency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

There are other health related goals and indicators related to poverty, education, food / nutrition (malnutrition), food supply, water / vector borne disease, mental health, and occupational health and safety.

Each country will be able to measure progress toward achieving the objectives using the indicators. Health indicators at the national and sub-national level consist of data obtained by national health agencies, statistical agencies e.g. census data, and regional health authorities. Lack of availability at the local and regional levels, constraining ability to measure indicators for all regions. There are also challenges for integrating, analyzing, and visualizing indicator data at a sub-national level (at various scales) by countries adopting the indicators due to  inconsistencies in data collection.
